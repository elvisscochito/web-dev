## About
*"Cascading Style Sheets"*

---

## Notes
* Works with selectors (html tags), properties (font-size, color, etc.), and values (12px, red, etc.)
* CSS is case sensitive
* They are applied in order of specificity (more specific to less specific) and also in order of appearance (top to bottom), 'cause the name "cascading" is what comes from
* Exist in 3 forms: inline, internal, and external; also the default browser styles are applied, the hierarchy is: inline > internal > external > default browser styles
* When using the right units:
    * Font Size: rem or em
    * Padding, Margin, Width, Height: rem or em
    * Border: px
    * width: rem or em, <!-- px, %, --> vw, vh and ch (for strings)
* __Flexbox vs CSS grid:__ Gris is for elements structure (two dimensional designs with columns and rows at the sime time such an entire page outline) and flexbox is for items layout (one dimension designs with rows or columns at single time such as string cards).
