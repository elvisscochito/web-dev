## Notes

* Created for development back-end (data administration and process, databases) web apps
* Now you can use JavaScript in server side, instead other languages like Java, PHP, Python, etc.
* Manage current connections in a asynchronous way, using Node.js to avoid blocking the web server
* The server can managed a lot of connections because delegated the task to the corresponding program part, it just receives the request and send the response
* It's a single threaded program, so it's not necessary to use threads
* Remember programming language are created for allow people to read and write code, not for machines, machines execute, interpret or compile it in machine code, in the same way Node.js is that program to help the computer/OS understand and execute it without a web browser
* Also it's possible create desktop and mobile apps using Node.js and web technologies
* It's a free and open source software, so you can use it in your own projects, exits a lot of frameworks and libraries to use with it
* Environments to use with javascript like mongodb or json begin to appear and side by side with Node.js makes a JavaScript a really important language
* Modules are an easy and common way to organize and reuse code when we are working with Node.js
* Modules stored functions, etc. and you only need to call them when you need them, of course it's important to import or export it
* In older times you used multiple scripts to build a complex program structure, but not anymore, now you can use modules to organize your code and in html you can use them too with <script type="modules" src="file.js"></script>
* Before you used required to import a module, but nowadays you can used import and export keywords to import and export modules
* Node have built-in modules, here's some: [link](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/ "Node.js"), [link](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/ref_modules.asp "w3schools")
* As you know, node.js allow create servers with http model to request and send data from itself
* dependencies are project settings meanwhile devDependencies are project tools for development the project itself
