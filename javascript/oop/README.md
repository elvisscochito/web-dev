# OOP

## What is?
Is a programming paradigm focus and based on the concept of "objects" instead of functions. In JS it's based on prototypes.

## Notes
__What are the principles of OOP:__ Modularity and reusability code, there's not a technical documentation for OOP, it's a way of thinking based on common sense from previous researches.

__Two accepted principles of OOP are (typically these requirements classify a language as 00):__
* Capability to model problems trough objects (and their relationships):
    * __Association:__ Objects can be associated/linked with independent objects.
    * __Aggregation:__ Objects can be aggregated/contained by other objects.
    * __Composition:__ Objects can be composed/contained by other objects.
* Support few principles to allow modularity and code reusability:
    * __Encapsulation:__ Objects can hide their internal state and behavior.
    * __Inheritance:__ Objects can inherit one, some or all features (properties, methods) from other objects.
    * __Polymorphism:__ Objects can be used in different ways (for example a method can be called with different data types parameters).

Is Javascript 00?
* Javascript lack of a class concept at the begging, but it's now possible to use it within the `class` keyword.
* Javascript support inheritance, but it's not a classical inheritance, it's based on prototypes.
* It does not enforce compliance with OOP, but principles are required for object not classes
* Class are not required, but its a convenient way to abstract objects with common properties
* A language can be OO even without classes like JS

Model trough objects to simplify the reality means __*`abstraction`*__.
